# Quick Start Guide

New to Celstomp? This guide walks you through creating your first animation in under 10 minutes.

## First Launch

When you open Celstomp, you'll see:

1. **Canvas** in the center - this is your drawing area
2. **Timeline** at the bottom - shows your animation frames
3. **Tools panel** on the left - brush, eraser, selection tools
4. **Layers panel** on the right - organize your artwork
5. **Color picker** - choose your brush color

## Your First Animation

### Step 1: Set Up Your Canvas

The canvas defaults to 16:9 aspect ratio. You can zoom with:
- **Scroll wheel** to zoom in/out
- **Middle-click drag** to pan around
- **Fit to screen** button to reset view

### Step 2: Choose a Brush

1. Click the brush tool (or press `1`)
2. Adjust brush size with `[` and `]` keys
3. Pick a color from the color wheel
4. Draw a simple shape on frame 1

### Step 3: Add Frames

1. Press `E` to add a new frame
2. Or click the `+` button in the timeline
3. You'll see frame 2 is now active (highlighted)

### Step 4: Enable Onion Skin

Press `O` to toggle onion skinning. This shows:
- **Green** tint for previous frames
- **Red** tint for next frames

This helps you see where your animation is coming from and going to.

### Step 5: Draw the Next Frame

With onion skin on, draw a slightly different pose. The semi-transparent overlay shows your previous drawing for reference.

### Step 6: Test Playback

Press **Spacebar** to play your animation. Press it again to stop.

### Step 7: Add More Frames

Continue adding frames (press `E`) and drawing. Most simple animations need 8-12 frames for a basic cycle.

## Working with Layers

Layers help you organize your animation:

1. **LINE** - Your outlines and sketches
2. **SHADE** - Shadows and depth
3. **COLOR** - Flat colors
4. **FILL** - Fill tool output
5. **PAPER** - Background

Click the layer name to select it. Use the eye icon to toggle visibility.

## Saving Your Work

**Important:** Celstomp autosaves to your browser's storage, but you should export regularly.

1. Press `Ctrl+S` or go to **File > Save Project**
2. Choose a location for your `.json` file
3. This file contains your entire animation

## Exporting Your Animation

When you're ready to share:

1. Go to **File > Export**
2. Choose your format:
   - **MP4** - Video file for social media
   - **GIF** - For web and messaging
   - **Image Sequence** - PNGs for advanced editing
3. Adjust settings (frame rate, quality)
4. Export and download

# Welcome to Celstomp

Celstomp is a free, browser-based 2D animation tool built for traditional frame-by-frame animation. Whether you're sketching out rough motion or polishing final frames, this tool gives you everything you need right in your web browser - no installation required.

## What Makes Celstomp Different

I built Celstomp while learning to code, coming from an art background myself. The goal was simple: make animation accessible to anyone with a browser and an idea. No subscriptions, no complicated setups, just open the site and start drawing.
